# Einstein's Bent Space-Time Simulation

A visually stunning, interactive gravity simulation that visualizes the curvature of space-time. This project demonstrates how massive objects (like stars) warp the fabric of space, influencing the motion of smaller objects (like planets) around them, based on General Relativity concepts.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Interactive Gravity Well**: A central "Sun" that warps the space-time grid.
*   **Space-Time Grid Visualization**: A dynamic grid that distorts in real-time to visualize the gravitational field.
*   **N-Body Physics**: Planets interact with the sun and are influenced by the curved space.
*   **Launch Planets**: Click and drag anywhere to sling new planets into orbit.
*   **Customizable Simulation**:
    *   Adjust Sun Mass (Gravity Well strength).
    *   Control Simulation Speed (Time dilation).
    *   Toggle Grid visibility.
*   **Visual Effects**:
    *   Planet trails to visualize orbits.
    *   Neon/Cyberpunk aesthetic.
    *   Smooth animations and glow effects.

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Launch Planet** | **Left Click & Drag** anywhere on the screen. The drag distance determines the launch velocity. |
| **Pause/Resume** | Press **Spacebar**. |
| **Clear Planets** | Click the **Clear Planets** button. |
| **Reset All** | Click the **Reset Simulation** button to restore defaults. |
| **Adjust Mass** | Use the **Sun Mass** slider to change the central gravity. |
| **Adjust Speed** | Use the **Simulation Speed** slider to speed up or slow down time. |

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Simply open `SpaceTime.html` in any modern web browser.
2.  No installation or server required.

## 🧠 The Physics

This simulation uses a simplified model of General Relativity:
*   **Mass tells space how to curve**: The central sun distorts the background grid, pulling grid points towards it.
*   **Space tells matter how to move**: Planets are accelerated towards the sun based on the inverse-square law of gravity, simulating the effect of rolling along the curved surface.
